Our code is divided between multiple files:
Project_4.ipynb
Project_4_Polynomial_questions.ipynb (questions 14-16)


For each file, the source data files must be located appropriately in subfolders of the current working directory.
Cells must also be run in order due to dependencies.

The following pacakges are used in each file:
Project_4.ipynb
	* pandas
	* numpy
	* pandas_profiling
	* seaborn
	* matplotlib
	* pycountry_convert
	* sklearn
	* scipy
	* lightbm
	* skopt
	* warnings
	* catboost
